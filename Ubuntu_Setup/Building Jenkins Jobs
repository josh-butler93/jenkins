Step 1: Give Jenkins Access to Docker

By default, Jenkins runs as its own user (jenkins), and that user needs permission to run Docker commands.
🛠️ Run this on your Ubuntu server:

sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins

This adds the jenkins user to the docker group.
🔄 Now restart Jenkins to apply changes:

sudo systemctl restart jenkins

    This is needed for the group membership change to take effect.

Let me know once you've run both commands and restarted Jenkins — then we’ll move to Step 2: Verifying Docker access from inside Jenkins.

Great — Jenkins should now have permission to use Docker.
✅ Step 2: Verify Docker Access from Jenkins

Let’s now test if Jenkins can actually run Docker commands.
🧪 Create a test job in Jenkins:

    Open Jenkins in your browser (usually at http://your-server-ip:8080).

    Click “New Item” from the Jenkins dashboard.

    Enter a name like docker-test.

    Select “Freestyle project” and click OK.

⚙️ Configure the job:

    Scroll down to the “Build” section.

    Click “Add build step” → “Execute shell”.

    In the shell command box, enter:

    docker version

    Click “Save”.

▶️ Run the job:

    Click “Build Now” on the left side.

    Then click the build number (e.g. #1).

    Click “Console Output”.

✅ Expected result:

You should see Docker version info printed, like:

Client:
 Version:           24.0.5
...

Server:
 Engine:
  Version:          24.0.5
...

If it fails, copy and paste the error message here and I’ll help debug it.

Let me know how that goes.
You said:
right now in the section with </> it says "No changes"
ChatGPT said:

Thanks — it sounds like you may be looking at the Build Changes tab (used for SCM-triggered builds like Git), not the Console Output where the actual shell script result appears.

Let’s make sure you’re checking the right place:
✅ To see the actual output of the docker version test:

    Go back to your job (e.g. docker-test).

    On the left, click “Build History” → click the build number (e.g. #1).

    Then click “Console Output”.

That’s where Jenkins will show the result of your docker version shell command.
What you’re looking for:

If it worked, the output will look like:

+ docker version
Client:
 Version:           24.0.5
...

Server:
 Engine:
  Version:          24.0.5
...

If it failed, it will show an error like:

Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket...

Can you check the Console Output section and let me know what you see?
You said:
oh okay the docker version command ran successfully
ChatGPT said:

Awesome — that confirms Jenkins can now access Docker! You're past the hardest part. 🎉
✅ Step 3: Build a Docker Image from Jenkins

Next, we’ll create a job that uses Jenkins to build a Docker image from a Dockerfile.
📦 Requirements:

Before we begin, make sure your Jenkins workspace (i.e. your project folder) has a simple Dockerfile.

If you don’t have one, here’s a quick example:
📝 Example Dockerfile (you can use this for testing):

# Dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html

And create a simple index.html in the same directory:

<!-- index.html -->
<h1>Hello from Jenkins and Docker!</h1>

Once those two files exist in a folder, we can:

    Create a new freestyle Jenkins job (or reuse the previous one).

    Point it to that folder (we can do this manually or connect to Git in a later step).

    Add a shell build step to run:

    docker build -t jenkins-demo .

Let me know when you have the Dockerfile and index.html ready, and we’ll move forward to creating the Jenkins build step.
You said:
# Dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
<!-- index.html -->
<h1>Hello from Jenkins and Docker!</h1>
where is this supposed to be created at
ChatGPT said:

Great question — here's where to place the files and how Jenkins will find them.
✅ Where to Create the Dockerfile and index.html

Since you're just starting and may not have source control (like Git) set up for Jenkins yet, you can manually place the files on the server where Jenkins runs.

Let’s do it this way:
🗂️ Step 1: Create a Local Build Folder for Jenkins to Use

On your Jenkins server (via terminal), run:

mkdir -p /var/jenkins_home/docker-demo
cd /var/jenkins_home/docker-demo

Then create the files:

echo 'FROM nginx:alpine
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html' > Dockerfile

echo '<h1>Hello from Jenkins and Docker!</h1>' > index.html

📁 This gives you:

/var/jenkins_home/docker-demo/
├── Dockerfile
└── index.html

✅ Step 2: Create a Freestyle Job in Jenkins

    Go to Jenkins dashboard → New Item

    Name it docker-build-test, choose Freestyle project, and click OK

    In the "Build" section, click:

        "Add build step" → "Execute shell"

    Paste this in the shell box:

    cd /var/jenkins_home/docker-demo
    docker build -t jenkins-demo .

    Click Save and then Build Now

Let me know once you've created that job and run it — or if you hit any errors.
You said:
so it ran successfully and when running the docker images command it show the jenkins-demo image
ChatGPT said:

Perfect! That confirms Jenkins is successfully building Docker images — you're now using Jenkins and Docker together like a pro. ✅🚀
✅ Step 4: Run the Container from Jenkins

Now let's have Jenkins run a container from the image it just built.
🛠️ Modify your existing Jenkins job (or create a new one):

    Go to the docker-build-test job → Click "Configure".

    Scroll to the Build section, and in the shell script, replace it with:

# Stop and remove any old container (optional cleanup)
docker rm -f jenkins-demo-container || true

# Go to the Dockerfile location
cd /var/jenkins_home/docker-demo

# Build the image
docker build -t jenkins-demo .

# Run the container
docker run -d --name jenkins-demo-container -p 8081:80 jenkins-demo

    This will expose your container on port 8081, mapping to NGINX inside.

▶️ Run the job again:

    Click Build Now

    Check Console Output to confirm the container starts

🌐 Test the running container:

On your browser, go to:

http://<your-server-ip>:8081

You should see:

Hello from Jenkins and Docker!

Let me know if that works — or if you want help verifying that the container is running.
You said:
its up and running and showing the 'Hello...!" output
ChatGPT said:

Beautiful — you now have Jenkins building Docker images and running containers, all automatically! 🎉🔥

At this point, you’ve got the basic pipeline working end-to-end. Here’s what you can do next, depending on your goals:
🔁 Next Possible Steps:

    Clean up old containers/images automatically
    (avoid duplicates or orphaned containers)

    Stop/start/redeploy containers conditionally
    (e.g., only restart if the build succeeds)

    Connect Jenkins to Git
    (trigger builds when you push code)

    Add container health checks / logs to Jenkins output

    Use Jenkins Pipeline (Jenkinsfile)
    (makes your build process version-controlled and more portable)

Would you like to move on to cleaning up old containers before each build, or are you thinking about Git or pipelines next?
You said:
we can just work on stopping the current container that we have up and running right now
ChatGPT said:

Perfect — let's go ahead and stop and remove the running container cleanly.
✅ Step 5: Stop and Remove the Running Docker Container

You mentioned it's named jenkins-demo-container, so on your server terminal, run:

docker stop jenkins-demo-container
docker rm jenkins-demo-container

🧼 What this does:

    docker stop gracefully stops the running container

    docker rm removes the stopped container (but not the image)

🧪 Optional: Verify it's gone

docker ps -a

You should no longer see jenkins-demo-container listed.

Let me know once that's done — we can then optionally add these cleanup steps to your Jenkins job so it happens automatically before each build.
You said:
i added it to the jenkins job both the docker ps -a and the docker images to verify that the image is still there
ChatGPT said:

Nice — that’s a great move! Adding those steps directly into the Jenkins job helps you visually confirm that:

    The container is removed ✅

    The image is still available ✅

🔄 Optional: Full Jenkins Shell Script Example

Here's what your shell block might look like now, fully integrated:

# Cleanup: Stop and remove the container if it's already running
docker rm -f jenkins-demo-container || true

# Navigate to build context
cd /var/jenkins_home/docker-demo

# Build the image
docker build -t jenkins-demo .

# List images (for verification)
docker images

# Run the container
docker run -d --name jenkins-demo-container -p 8081:80 jenkins-demo

# List all containers (for verification)
docker ps -a

You now have a basic but powerful container automation flow in Jenkins.

Would you like to save this whole process as a Jenkins pipeline (Jenkinsfile) next, or are you happy sticking with freestyle jobs for now?
You said:
what is the pipeline used for
ChatGPT said:

Great question — let’s break it down clearly.
✅ What Is a Jenkins Pipeline?

A Jenkins pipeline is a way to define your entire build process as code using a file called Jenkinsfile. Instead of clicking through the UI to configure each build step (like in Freestyle jobs), you write the steps in a text file — this gives you:
🔑 Benefits of Jenkins Pipelines
Feature	Freestyle Jobs	Pipelines (Jenkinsfile)
Version-controlled	❌ Stored only in Jenkins UI	✅ Stored in your Git repo
Reusable across projects	❌ Harder	✅ Easily copied or templated
Complex workflows	😬 Awkward or plugin-heavy	✅ Built-in support for conditionals, loops, stages
Easier collaboration	❌ Manual edits	✅ Everyone can edit Jenkinsfile like code
Better visibility	❌ Linear steps	✅ Visual stages and logs per stage
🔧 What Can You Do in a Jenkinsfile?

Here's a simple example of a Jenkinsfile that does what your freestyle job does now:

pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Clean Container') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker rm -f jenkins-demo-container || true'
            }
        }
        stage('Build Image') {
            steps {
                sh '''
                cd /var/jenkins_home/docker-demo
                docker build -t jenkins-demo .
                '''
            }
        }
        stage('Run Container') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker run -d --name jenkins-demo-container -p 8081:80 jenkins-demo'
            }
        }
        stage('Verify') {
            steps {
                sh '''
                docker images
                docker ps -a
                '''
            }
        }
    }
}

When to Use Pipelines:

    You're working with Git or version control

    You want repeatable, portable builds

    You’re automating builds, tests, deploys, or cleanup
